That was months before dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters pitched tents on the UW Quad last week, as they called on the university to end its century-old relationship with the aerospace and defense manufacturer, among other actions. Protesters nationwide have also called for universities to distance themselves from Boeing and other companies supporting the Israel Defense Forces, but UW students face a particular challenge: Their school may have the most to lose. Boeing has donated to the UW since 1917, when William E. Boeing gifted the school a wind tunnel to establish an aeronautics curriculum. It was just a year after he founded the company, and over the past century the two Seattle institutions have formed a symbiotic relationship. Thousands of UW graduates, especially from engineering programs, have found work at Boeing. The company has funded student scholarships and endowed multiple professorships named after UW grads who became Boeing leaders. The Boeing name is splashed across the campus: The Boeing Advanced Research Center, The Boeing Auditorium, the William E. Boeing Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics. In 2022 the company gave $10 million toward a new interdisciplinary engineering building. But for protesters like undergraduate student Sofia Torres, 19, these close ties ultimately serve Boeing the most. Students are concerned that UW research could help develop Boeing technology that “indiscriminately targets Palestinians,” she said. “We don’t want o",0.10164884135472368
https://urbanmilwaukee.com/pressrelease/state-sanctioned-inequity/,"  Milwaukee, WI – If you live in Wisconsin, there’s a pretty good chance you’ve been asked to raise your own property taxes to fund local schools at some point in the past decade. All told, there have been 1,077 public school referenda on ballots across the state since 2015, including 103 in spring 2024 alone. The listed reasons run the gamut from building improvements to deferred maintenance on aging facilities, teacher pay to simply keeping the lights on. 

Underlying all of these, however, is a little-known feature of our school funding formula that favors private schools at the expense of taxpayer-supported, constitutionally-guaranteed public education. It has to do with how we fund services for kids with special needs. Currently, public schools receive a base reimbursement rate for special education services of 33%. When all types of aid are included, this leaves districts across Wisconsin with about 60% of their special education costs unreimbursed, for a $1.2 billion shortfall in the 2022-23 school year alone. Meanwhile, private schools participating in the Special Needs Scholarship Program, which served just 2,217 students that same year, are guaranteed a 90% reimbursement rate. Statewide, there were over 122,187 students with special needs in ‘22-23, as indicated by those with Individualized Education Plans (IEPs). Just how big of a problem is this, and what does it have to do with the rise in school referenda? To find out, we took the 68 districts with operating referenda on spring 2024 ballots and matched up the amount of the operating referenda with the unreimbursed special education costs for the 2022-23 school year (the most recent year available). What we found was staggering: This is not sustainable. People support their public schools, but there are limits to how much they are willing to raise their own taxes. Where referendum passage rates once topped 80%, less than 60% passed this spring, for a total of $1.0 billion. With a multi-billion state bud",0.15208513708513707
https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/rafah-invasion-has-israel-coordinated-egypt-attack,"As the Israeli army announced it had seized control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing, questions have been raised about whether Israel has violated key agreements with Egypt and what level of coordination might have taken place with Cairo. If carried out without Egypt's consent, Israel's control of the Rafah crossing may present a threat to a September 2005 agreement with Egypt, known as the Philadelphi Accord and the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty.  The 2005 accord, signed prior to Israel's military withdrawal from Gaza that year, established the Philadelphi Corridor: a 14-km long, 100-metre-wide buffer zone along the entire border between Gaza and Egypt. The corridor was established in a 3km-wide area, known as Zone D, that the 1979 pact made demilitarised.  Under the Philadelphi Accord, Egypt is allowed to deploy 750 border guards to patrol the border along the corridor for counterterrorism and non-military purposes, including the prevention of smuggling and infiltration across the border.  According to the 1979 peace treaty, Israel is only allowed to deploy a limited force of four infantry battalions, their military installations and field fortifications, along with UN observers. It not allowed, however, to deploy tanks, artillery and anti-aircraft missiles except individual surface-to-air missiles. Any change of these terms would require mutual agreement between Egypt and Israel, according to the treaty.   Likewise, the Philadelphi Accord requires mutual agreement to amend its terms. It also stipulates that Egypt and Israel would establish a coordination and liaison system for real-time exchange of intelligence between the two sides.  It is unclear whether any coordination took place prior to Tuesday's occupation of the crossing, which essentially gives Israel control of the Philadelphi Corridor for the first time since Israel's military withdrawal from Gaza in 2005.

He finds it important that over the past 20 years, being European has become part of most Hungarians’ identity. The ratio of citizens who regard themselves as both Hungarian and European has risen from 33 to 64%, with a further 11% choosing the option ’European and Hungarian’.

In Magyar Narancs Péter Heil, the chief EU expert of the Democratic Coalition, accuses the government of turning its back on key European values. In a long article, he writes that if Hungary sought EU membership today, her application would certainly be rejected. As a result, he adds, the European Union is withholding at least two thirds of the funds due to Hungary. Relations with Brussels can only improve, he believes, once Hungary gets rid of its incumbent government.

In Élet és Irodalom, former left-wing Foreign Minister and European Commissioner Péter Balázs dismisses the Prime Minister’s announced intention to ’occupy Brussels’ as fully unrealistic. His radical right-wing allies, he argues, will not conquer any top positions within the European Union as a result of the elections to be held in June.

A different government, Balázs claims, might use Hungary’s role as the rotating president of the Union in the second half of the year to improve the country’s standing within the community, but Mr Orbán and his cabinet have too many conflicts behind them to do so.

In Magyar Hang, János Reichert suggests that Fidesz can realistically hope to win another resounding victory in the European Parliamentary elections. He dismisses as mendacious the argument of the government that Fidesz is the only possible option for voters who want peace in Europe, but concedes that such slogans may well have an impact.

Each year, the American Lung Association celebrates LUNG FORCE, Lung Cancer Action Week, connected with Turquoise Takeover, to raise awareness of lung cancer, advance funds, and provide further research on prevention and early detection.1 This week (May 6- 12, 2024) marks the 10th anniversary of LUNG FORCE, which has raised over $30 million for lung cancer research.2 Image credit: didesign | stock.adobe.com The American Cancer Society estimates about 234,580 new cases of lung cancer and about 125,070 annual deaths. The study authors noted that lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the US, accounting for 1 in 5 of all cancer-related deaths. Additionally, diagnoses are more common in adults 65 years and older, compared with individuals younger than 45.3 “Hearing the word ‘cancer’ is scary — hearing the diagnosis of lung cancer was terrifying,” said Nancy Smith, in a news release from the American Lung Association. Smith was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2015 and declared cancer free in 2016.1 However, new diagnoses of lung cancer have decreased as further research has advanced early detection and treatment, along with a reduction in smoking, according to study authors.3 Researchers from the American Lung Association noted that the 5-year survival rate of lung cancer has increased by 40% in the past decade, also thanks to improved early detection from lung cancer screening and advancements in research. Since 2016, the FDA has approved 50 new lung cancer treatments that can improve outcomes.1 The annual Lung Cancer Action Week and Turquoise Takeover encourages individuals to share a selfie on social media wearing turquoise—the signature color of LUNG FORCE—and raise awareness for lung cancer by sharing their experiences with lung cancer.

BERLIN‘S GOT IT!” a local curator exclaimed midway through the weeklong festivities of Gallery Weekend Berlin, expressing a view that seemed rare and unanimous: Excellent shows were opening everywhere. How refreshing and well timed! Instead of the division reportedly imploding the Berlin art scene over the past months, we met statements everyone could get behind—and some good art! Combined with spring weather that flirted with summer, the endless days and nights of viewing and drinking and dancing and chatting felt like the first good-mood event of this art world in recent memory.

 








 The best and brightest exhibitions came from artists based throughout the sprawling city: Julius von Bismarck showed collapsing taxidermied and sculpted wolves at Esther Schipper, while Lisa Jo turned Galerie Molitor into a Brutalist cathedral for her digi-modernist abstractions; Matt Mullican’s literally encyclopedic installation at Thomas Schulte seemed both in opposition and harmony with Constantin Thun’s enigmatic Minimalism at Sweetwater. Peter Wächtler’s abstracted walls at Lars Friedrich and Angharad Williams’s love letter to the hackneyed visuals of Berlin’s streets at Schiefe Zähne tackled architecture in such divergent ways it became a parlor game trying to link the shows, which occupy comparable first-floor gallery spaces, with those one ran into. At Trautwein Herleth, Sung Tieu’s continued mining (merchandising?) of colonial histories included a floor work embedded with French Indochinese currency that two separate collectors told me they chased in vain to add to their collection. Part of what makes them art collectors, remember, is the desire to have money where they can see it.

https://www.ox.ac.uk/event/cyril-foster-lecture-2024-declining-success-civil-resistance,"South School Over the past 50 years, the Cyril Foster Lecture series has delivered engaging lectures from some of the world's most influential policymakers and academics. This year's lecture will be given by Professor Erica Chenoweth, a leading expert on mass movements, nonviolent resistance, terrorism, political violence, revolutions, and state repression. The lecture will be introduced by Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Dr Sir Michael Jacobs, and chaired by Cyril Foster Lecture Chair, Professor Neta Crawford. Professor Erica Chenoweth will explore the puzzling decline in the success of civil resistance movements in the past decade, even as unarmed movements have become more popular worldwide. The findings have implications for the future of nonviolent alternatives to armed struggle, as well as to the ability of pro-democratic movements to defeat authoritarian challenges. Erica Chenoweth is the Academic Dean for Faculty Engagement and the Frank Stanton Professor of the First Amendment at Harvard Kennedy School, Faculty Dean at Pforzheimer House at Harvard College, and a Susan S. and Kenneth L. Wallach Professor at the Harvard Radcliffe Institute. They study political violence and its alternatives. At Harvard, Chenoweth directs the Nonviolent Action Lab, an innovation hub that provides empirical evidence in support of movement-led political transformation. Event Schedule About the Cyril Foster Lecture Series This lecture series is the legacy of Cyril A Foster. We know very little about him. Mr Foster owned several small sweet shops in and around London and lived alone in Essex. On his death, he left a bequest to the University, asking us to create an annual lecture series on the ‘elimination of war and the better understanding of the nations of the world’. This wish is particularly unusual, as he had no previous connection to the University. His kind and generous gift continues to promote international cooperation.

South African citrus growers from the Western and Northern Capes are gearing up for a significant export season to the United States, with expectations to ship around 60,000 tons of citrus through Cape Town to Philadelphia. This marks a 9% increase over the 2018 record of 55,000 tons, according to the Citrus Growers Association. The association highlights that the 230 growers exporting to the US support approximately 30,000 jobs in rural areas, with an anticipated increase in employment due to the rise in exports. These exports are coordinated under Summer Citrus, a collective established in 1999 to streamline logistics, marketing, and sales to enhance market access during the US summer. Over the past decade, this initiative has boosted citrus exports to the US by 60%. The current growth is attributed to higher mandarin production and demand in the US, alongside increased shipments of oranges, particularly summer navels, spurred by heightened consumer demand for vitamin C amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite logistical challenges posed by the pandemic and lockdown measures, Summer Citrus and its partners have quickly adapted, ensuring the continued movement of planned volumes.
